Project submission.
The overall solution for the Adobe Gensolve Hackathon.

# Objective:
Our mission is to identify, regularize, and beautify curves in 2D Euclidean space. This project starts by focusing on closed curves and expands to more complex shapes. The project also covers symmetry detection and curve completion techniques.

# Solutions
1. Curve Regularization: Identify and categorize shapes based on regular geometric forms.

2. Symmetry Detection: Explore and detect symmetries in closed curves.

3. Occlusion Completion: Complete curves that have been occluded or fragmented.

# Problem Description:
The goal is to develop an end-to-end process that takes polylines of line art as input and outputs a set of curves defined as regularized and completed curves. Initially, line art will be presented in the form of polylines, which are sequences of points. 

# Key Tasks:
1. Regularize Curves: Identify regular shapes such as straight lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, rounded rectangles, regular polygons, and star shapes.
2. Exploring Symmetry: Detect reflection symmetries in closed shapes.
3. Completing Incomplete Curves: Identify and complete curves that have gaps or are occluded by other shapes.
